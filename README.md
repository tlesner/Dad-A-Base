## Description

This project allows users to test features before deployment. The reason behind this is for users to have a seamless experience while performing certain actions. Being able to go through the database will help minimize erros. This project uses Cypress testing. I was able to learn how to test out components based off existing code. It helped me get more practice in mapping out each step and adding the proper functions accordingly.
