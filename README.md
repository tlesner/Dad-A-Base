# 🛞 Dad-A-Base 🛠️
"Because some kids don’t have someone to ask… so we built a place they could."

## 👔 Description

Ever wondered how to change a tire, tie a tie, or patch a wall without someone around to show you?  
**Dad-A-Base** is your go-to hub for all the grown-up things no one taught you—powered by videos from real parents and trusted creators. No cringe, no fluff, just good advice.

This project allows users to test features before deployment. The reason behind this is for users to have a seamless experience while performing certain actions. Being able to go through the database will help minimize errors. This project uses Cypress testing. I was able to learn how to test out components based off existing code. It helped me get more practice in mapping out each step and adding the proper functions accordingly.

## Installation

These will be the following downloads/ installations that will be necessary. For starters, these libraries will need to be downloaded onto your computer. VS Code, or some sort of code editor, will need to be downloaded as well. Inside the code editor, you will need the Inquirer package downloaded. Running "npm i" in the command terminal will install all the node modules you will need. 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, GraphQL
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Auth**: JWT (Parents sign in, kids get access)
- **Deployment**: Render




## Usage

In order for this project to work properly, you will need to download the libraries onto your local device for use with your code editor. In the code editor, you will open up a terminal and begin installing the node modules. To begin using the application type "npm run build" into the terminal. After this begins you will run "npm run start". This command should begin running the site on your local device. You will also need to install "cypress using command npm install cypress --save-dev".

## 🧪 Testing 
- Login and authentication behavior  
- Video browsing and bookmarking  
- Modal rendering and closing  
- Navigation between pages  
- Favorites functionality

We also recommend writing additional tests for edge cases like token expiration or API errors
