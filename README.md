# 🛞 Dad-A-Base — Because Some Kids Don’t Have Someone to Ask…🛠️

> _"So we built a place they could."_

## 👔 Description

Ever wondered how to change a tire, tie a tie, or patch a wall without someone around to show you?  
**Dad-A-Base** is your go-to hub for all the grown-up things no one taught you — powered by videos from real parents and trusted creators. No cringe. No fluff. Just practical advice.

This app provides a user-friendly interface where parents can curate helpful video content and kids can easily explore, bookmark, and learn. Testing plays a huge role in delivering a smooth user experience — Cypress was used to test key components and interactions, ensuring everything works as intended.
